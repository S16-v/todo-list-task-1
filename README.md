# todo-list-task-1

This code provides basic functionality for managing tasks in a to-do list:

Adding tasks with priorities and due dates.
Removing tasks.
Marking tasks as completed.
Listing all tasks.

For cross-session persistence, tasks are saved in a JSON file called tasks.json. The script and this file are created in the same directory. This code can be further expanded to meet your needs; for example, you might add error handling, more complex input validation, or improve the user interface. In addition, if you require more sophisticated data management features, you may swap out the file-based storage for a straightforward database library like SQLite.

# todo-list-task-1

This code provides basic functionality for managing tasks in a to-do list:

Removing tasks.

Marking tasks as completed.

Listing all tasks.

For cross-session persistence, tasks are saved in a JSON file called tasks.json. The script and this file are created in the same directory.
